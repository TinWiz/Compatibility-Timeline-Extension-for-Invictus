 l6_christian.1.desc:0 "A small band of Galileans have reportedly been causing trouble around Jerusalem. Some claim that these rural fishers were somehow able to speak the languages of Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Judeans, Cappadocians, Pontics, Phrygians, Pamphylians, Egyptians, Libyans, Romans, Cretans, and Arabs. In any case, their words must have struck a chord as they apparently were able to add 3000 to their number."
