 te_christianity.41.t:0 "St. Thomas travels to India"
 te_christianity.41.desc:1 "The Apostle Thomas is believed to have left northwest India when an attack threatened and traveled by vessel to the Malabar Coast, possibly visiting southeast Arabia and Socotra en route, and landing at the flourishing port of Muziris (c. AD 50) in the company of a Jewish merchant. Thomas baptized several families, namely Pakalomattom, Sankarapuri, Kalli, Kaliyankal and more. From there he is said to have preached the gospel throughout the Malabar Coast. The various churches he founded were located mainly on the Periyar River and its tributaries and along the Kerala coast, where there were Jewish colonies."

 te_christianity.7.t:0 "Church of Rome"
 te_christianity.7.desc_1:1 "News reaches your ears that a new religion has spread up from the land of Judea, and has infected the eternal city of [rome_church_province.GetName] with its foreign doctrine. They say that a man who was crucified as a criminal then resurrected from the dead and now reigns as the one and only true god. Fantastic rumours abound that these cultists gather at night to eat the flesh and drink the blood of this God-Man. Worst of all, these fanatics refuse to offer worship to any of our Roman gods and goddesses!"

 te_christianity.71.t:0 "In hoc signo vinces"
 te_christianity.71.desc:1 "You wake in a cold sweat as the sun's rays move over your eyes. You remember fondly the vision of Sol Invictus crowning you with wreaths as a promise of power and might. Memories of many battles fought sear your mind while you consider the future of your rulership and what direction is best for the prosperity of your realm. Out upon the sky, something appears there, strange and new, not like a cloud or anything natural. Is it Sol again?\n\nSuddenly the sun seems to darken, and you grasp that another vision is upon you. A cool breath whispers over the wind and a blinding light flashes through the heavens, not from the sun, but as if beyond the sun, transcending it, some immense power beyond all the gods and powers of history; now — a sign. A large decussate cross-beam overlain with a symbol...letters, not Latin, but Greek.... You gaze in awe.\n\nThe cool air gives way to an intense heat from a luminous but unseen source surrounding the horizon that bathes you in light and warmth, almost burning. A feeling of tremendous strength and confidence fills you. The brilliant letters contrast sharper and come into focus as if making the whole sky their canvas for your eyes to behold. Chi Rho.\n\nAfter a moment of wonder at what it means, a clear message communicates to you like a thunderous voice, but silent and internal, yet unmistakeable in your mind. 'In this sign you will conquer.' And the meaning is revealed by a sudden understanding. This is a sign of Christos, ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ, the religious title of Jesus of Nazareth, that mysterious Jewish man who was crucified so many centuries ago, and whom the Christians hail as the anointed Son of God — the God beyond all the gods.\n\nAre you now a Christian, too?"
 te_christianity.71.a:0 "Yes, I accept this as the divine will and uphold the triumph of Chi Rho."

 te_christianity.8.t:0 "Church of Antioch"
 te_christianity.8.desc:1 "It has been a generation since the 'Christians' first appeared in these lands, proclaiming a new dying-and-rising god, but this time in the form of a Jewish man, Jesus the Messiah or Christ, who actually lived less than a century ago in Palestine, and was crucified in the old city of Jerusalem. He rose from the dead three days after his death, his followers claimed, and they say everyone will rise from the dead at the end of time; anyone who worships him will become like gods, but those who refuse to listen will fall down into the underworld forever. These Christians have now grown and their community, the Christian Church, is now well established in [antioch_church_province.GetName]."
 te_christianity.8.a:0 "We must be careful to contain this dangerous cult lest it overwhelm us."

 te_christianity.9.t:0 "Church of Alexandria"
 te_christianity.9.desc:1 "The Church of [alexandria_church_province.GetName] in Egypt is the Christian Church headed by the Patriarch of Alexandria. It is one of the original Apostolic Sees of Christianity, alongside Rome, Antioch, and Jerusalem.

 te_christianity.10.t:0 "Church of Edessa"
 te_christianity.10.desc:1 "Edessa (now Şanlıurfa) in northwestern Mesopotamia was from apostolic times the principal center of Syriac-speaking Christianity. It was the capital of an independent kingdom from 132 BC and celebrated as an important centre of Greco-Syrian culture. Edessa was also noted for its Jewish community, with proselytes in the royal family. Strategically located on the main trade routes of the Fertile Crescent, it was easily accessible from Antioch, where the mission to the Gentiles was inaugurated. When early Christians were scattered abroad because of persecution, some found refuge at Edessa. Thus the Edessan church traced its origin to the Apostolic Age (which may account for its rapid growth), and Christianity even became the state religion for a time. The Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the Parthian and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, known as the Assyrian Church of the East."
 te_christianity.10.a:0 "Our old gods fade like silent statues at the dusk of a forgotten era." 
 #, while this God-Man and his disciples arise like jubilant children at the dawn of a new day. Do we cling to our ancestral customs or accept this novel revelation?"

 te_christianity.25.t:0 "The Mysterious Star"
 te_christianity.25.desc:1 "A strange bright star appears in the night sky and seems as if to herald a mighty event. You do not know what has happened, but the world feels changed, somehow. Wise lorekeepers in the realm tell you this is a great omen by a powerful deity. The mysterious star has frightened the populace."

They have been seen attending and participating in gatherings of these Christians who preach openly that salvation is only possible from the Jewish God, who they believe became incarnate as a man in the land of Judea. What should be done with them?"

They have been seen attending and participating in gatherings of these Christians who preach openly that salvation is only possible by worshipping Jesus, the crucified Nazarene, whom they continue to believe is risen from the dead and reigns as the true King of the Jews.
