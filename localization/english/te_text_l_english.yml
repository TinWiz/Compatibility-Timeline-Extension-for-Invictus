 christianity:0 "Christian"
 desc_christianity:0 "Christianity is the name given to that definite system of religious belief and practice founded by a Jewish man, Jesus of Nazareth, in the country of Judea, and was promulgated, after its founder's death, for the acceptance of the whole world, by certain chosen men among his followers. These began their mission on the day of Pentecost, around A.D. 30, which day is regarded, accordingly, as the birthday of the Christian Church. Beginning as an obscure sect of Judaism, the chosen leaders among the followers of Jesus, called the Apostles, travelled throughout the world to spread the 'Good News' that their founder, whom they hailed as the prophesied Messiah or Christ ('the anointed one'), is the Son of the only God and had resurrected from the dead to show his power, promising that he would some day return in glory to judge all human souls according to their deeds. The Apostles taught that whoever repents of evil habits and prays to this Jesus for mercy would be saved from eternal death in the underworld and glorified with new life everlasting in a realm of the blessed."

 manichaeism:0 "Manichaean"

Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious movements and Gnosticism."
