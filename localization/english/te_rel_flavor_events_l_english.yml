 te_rel_flavor.1.desc_1:1 "Word has reached you that some community of the Jewish sect called 'The Way' have nested in [early_xian_community_target.GetName]. You hear stories of secret 'love feasts' and divine sacrifice, with rituals of eating the flesh and drinking the blood of a Hebrew man whom these people call 'Christos,' the Son of God. Worst of all, they refuse to worship any other gods, including your own. You are not sure what to make of all of this. Your nation's priests are upset and demand that you root out this infiltrating new cult that is spreading among the people and gaining converts. There are others who sympathize with the Christos-followers, and their numbers are growing."
 te_rel_flavor.1.desc_2:1 "Word has reached you that some community of the new sect of our religion called 'The Way' have nested in [early_xian_community_target.GetName]. You hear stories of secret 'love feasts' and divine sacrifice, with rituals of eating the flesh and drinking the blood of a Nazarene man whom these people say is the Moshiach, and the Son of God! This appears to be blasphemy against the Most High. You are not sure what to make of all of this. Your nation's priests are upset and demand that you root out this infiltrating new cult that is spreading among the people and gaining converts. There are others who sympathize with their claims to have found the true Moshiach, and their numbers are growing."

 te_rel_flavor.2.desc_1:1 "After hunting down communities of the strange Jewish sect, who are known as Christians, you learn that a large assembly of these cultists, an 'ekklesia' or 'church', have taken root in [early_xian_church_target.GetName]! [pagan_or_jewish_official_priest.GetName] urges you to destroy them before they become too powerful. Rumours of human sacrifice fill your ears, but you have not found any evidence among them of any ritual killings. Their refusal to pay homage to the gods is disturbing. Some report that they are harmless however, and that they are helping the poor in the city. Yet they are preaching that there is only one God, that 'Christos' who was crucified, rose from the dead, and will come to judge anyone who does not worship him. What is to be done?"
 te_rel_flavor.2.desc_2:1 "After hunting down communities of the strange upstart sect of our true religion, who are known to the Gentiles as Christians, you learn that a large assembly of these cultists, an 'ekklesia' or 'church' in the Gentile tongue, have taken root in [early_xian_church_target.GetName]! [pagan_or_jewish_official_priest.GetName] urges you to destroy them before they become too powerful. Rumours of human sacrifice fill your ears, but you have not found any evidence for such abominations. Their treatment of Gentiles as equals and refusal to require obedience to the Mosaic Law is disturbing. Some report that they are righteous however, and that they are helping the poor in the city. Yet they are preaching that El Elyon has a Son, that Nazarene who was crucified, saying he rose from the dead, and will come to judge anyone who does not worship him. What is to be done?"
