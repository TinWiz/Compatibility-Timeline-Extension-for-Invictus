 te_judaism.1.desc:1 "The roots of Judaism in India may reach back to King Solomon's time; some claim to have been remnants of the ancient Ten Lost Tribes, and exiles after the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions of Israel. St. Thomas the Apostle visited the community of Jews in Cochin in South India, and in the late second century CE more travellers arrived after their homeland was invaded again."

 te_judaism.21.t:0 "Jewish Emigration"
 te_judaism.21.desc:1 "In recent years many more of the foreigners called Jews who spurn our gods are seeking refuge in our blessed land. Their homeland has been conquered and they are heavily persecuted by the rulers, who also take offence at these peoples' refusal to recognize any other gods. They say their own god is the only God! Yet they seem to expect protection from us, and many of their fellow countrymen have already made a home here for some time."
 te_judaism.21.a:0 "Perhaps we should continue our policy of tolerance for these poor refugees."
 te_judaism.21.b:0 "These foreign haters of our gods are not welcome here. Turn them away!"

te_judaism.6.desc:1 "Yemenite Jews, also known as Teimanim (from Hebrew; romanized, Yehude Teman), are those Jews who live, or once lived, in Yemen, and their descendants maintaining their customs. There are numerous accounts and traditions concerning the arrival of Jews in various regions in Southern Arabia. One tradition suggests that King Solomon sent Jewish merchant marines to Yemen to prospect for gold and silver with which to adorn his Temple in Jerusalem. Another legend says that Yemeni tribes converted to Judaism after the Queen of Sheba's visit to King Solomon. In the aftermath of the Jewish revolts, there was significant Jewish emigration to southern Arabia, famous for its prosperous trade, particularly in spices."
