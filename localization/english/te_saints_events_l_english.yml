Andrew preached in Epirus, Cappadocia, Scythia, Thrace, Macedonia and Achaea. He preached from eastern Anatolia to western Georgia.

 te_saints.2.desc:1 "The Apostle Thomas is one of the twelve Apostles who accompanied Jesus as friends and students for three years. Thomas founded the Church in India and the surrounding areas, travelling as far as China to spread the gospel of the Risen One. Thomas doubted the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth until he personally saw and touched the risen Christ according to the testimony of the Apostles. Hence he was nicknamed 'the Doubter'. Thomas founded the first seven Christian communities on the Malabar coast and died a martyr in Mailapur on the opposite Coromandel coast."

 te_saints.3.t:0 "Saul of Tarsus"
 te_saints.3.desc:1 "Saul of Tarsus was a successful early Christian missionary and one of the earliest Christian theologians. As a Greek educated Jew and law-abiding Pharisee with Roman citizenship, Saul — also known as Paul — initially persecuted the followers of Jesus Christ, whom, apart from his appearance at his conversion, he never met. Since his conversion, however, he saw himself as a God-called Apostle of the gospel for the people. As such, he proclaimed the risen Jesus Christ, especially to non-Jews or 'Gentiles'. To do this, he traveled to the eastern Mediterranean and founded several Christian communities there. He kept in touch with them through his letters, preserved as epistles in the Christian scriptures."

 te_saints.8.desc:1 "Cornelius was a Roman centurion in Caesarea Maritima. He is considered to be one of the first non-Jews to be baptized as a Christian. According to the biblical story, he met an angel who asked him to bring the Apostle Simon Peter over to hear a message from him. The Apostle Simon Peter was convinced, also in a vision, that the message of salvation also applies to the Gentiles. Until then, he had assumed that it only applied to the Jews. Peter then allowed himself to be led into Cornelius' house by servants. Cornelius prostrated himself before Peter, but the latter did not allow him to worship him. While Peter was preaching, the Holy Spirit fell on everyone who was listening. That this also happened to non-Jews is presented as a great surprise for Peter and his Jewish companions. Peter then ordered Cornelius and his friends and relatives to be baptized. According to the biblical record, Cornelius is the first Roman Gentile Christian."

After the birth of Jesus they returned to Jerusalem, where the presentation of the Lord was taking place in the temple. At an unspecified point in time after Jesus was born, the family had to flee to Egypt on the orders of an angel, which Joseph received in a dream, since King Herod, for fear of a prophesied newborn King of the Jews who would displace him, killed all of the infant boys in Bethlehem. Later, on divine direction, which Joseph received in a dream, the family moved back to Palestine, where, by Joseph's decision, they did not settle in Judea, where Bethlehem is, but in Galilee in the village of Nazareth, where Jesus grew up. Joseph died in peace some years before Jesus appeared in public."

The address of the angel ('Greetings, you favored one, the Lord is with you') places Mary at the center of the salvation story. She asks the angel how this should be done, since she had never known a man intimately. In answering, the angel told her she would conceive by the Holy Spirit.

Together with his brother John, James was one of the first called disciples, along with Andrew and Simon Peter. James was on the Mount of Transfiguration with Peter and John when Jesus spoke to Elijah and Moses, and in the Garden of Gethsemane he witnessed Jesus in agony before the Passion he suffered. James and John received the Aramaic nickname 'Boanerges', which means Sons of Thunder, from Jesus because of their impetuous nature. After the Resurrection, James was in Jerusalem with the other Apostles. He was executed with the sword during the reign of Herod Agrippa I over all of Judea (AD 41–44)."

Simon was the spokesman for the disciples or Apostles, the first confessor, but also denied Jesus during His trial. According to Christian scriptures, Jesus answered Simon's confession of Christ with a special promise, 'You are Peter (Greek, petros) and on this rock (petra) I will build my church (ekklesia) and the powers (pylai, literally gates) of the underworld (hades) will not overwhelm.' Peter was an eyewitness to the risen Lord and one of the leaders of the early church in Jerusalem. Peter was the first bishop of Rome and Christ gave Peter and the successor bishops of Rome priority as leaders, teachers and judges of all Christians. The popes are therefore also referred to as 'successors of Peter'."

John Mark was one of the Seventy Disciples of Jesus of Nazareth and hosted the disciples in his house after Jesus's death. A tradition holds that the resurrected Jesus Christ came to Mark's house, and that the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples at Pentecost in the same house. About 19 years after the Ascension of Jesus, after travelling with Simon Peter, the leader of the Twelve Apostles, and composing a Gospel, Mark the Evangelist travelled to Alexandria, where he founded a church, the first in Africa. The pagans of the city resented his efforts to turn the Alexandrians away from the worship of their traditional gods. In AD 68, they placed a rope around his neck and dragged him through the streets until he was dead."
