 te_manichees.1.t:0 "Manichaeism Spreads to East and West"
 te_manichees.1.desc:1 "Manichaeism was quickly successful and spread far through the Aramaic-speaking regions. It thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire. It was briefly the main rival to Christianity in the competition to replace classical paganism. A pagan emperor known for persecuting Christians also persecuted the Manichaeans, complaining how the Manichaeans 'have set up new and hitherto unheard-of sects in opposition to the older creeds so that they might cast out the doctrines vouchsafed to us in the past by the divine favour for the benefit of their own depraved doctrine'."
 te_manichees.1.a:0 "Another new doctrine springs forth and tickles our ears. Should we listen?"

 te_manichees.2.t:0 "The Execution of Mani"
 te_manichees.2.desc:1 "A Zoroastrian Persian emperor imprisoned and ordered the execution of Mani. His followers depicted Mani's death as a crucifixion in a conscious analogy to the crucifixion of Jesus. There is a story which claims that he was flayed, and his corpse suspended over the main gate of the great city of Gundeshapur; however, there is no historical basis for this account. It is probable that his body was mutilated via post-mortem decapitation, and his head put on display, which may be the original source of the embellishment."
 te_manichees.2.a:0 "Executing these religious fanatics does not seem to have the desired effect."
 NICKNAME_MANI:0 "'Buddha of Light'"
 prophet_mani_man:0 "You have uncovered a lifelike portait of Mani, the 'Prophet of Light'."

 te_manichees.3.t:0 "An Enlightened Listener"
 te_manichees.3.desc:1 "Dusk descends on another challenging day as ruler, and you unwind with an evening stroll. As you turn a corner of a shadowed road you see a cloaked man standing in your path. He gleams an eerie smile at you. Your guards shove him aside roughly to make way and as you pass he asks cryptically, 'Have you heard the Light?' You notice his lack of any fear and steady gaze on you, and you vaguely recognize him, a member of the elite but lesser families."
 te_manichees.3.a:0 "We know where to find him."
 minor_manichee_char_create:0 "There is a notable minority of Manichaeans in your country."

 te_manichees.31.t:0 "Another Enlightened Listener"
 te_manichees.31.desc:1 "Yet again you hear of a devout follower of the eccentric and syncretic religion of a proclaimed 'Last Prophet' from Persia, Mani, among the minor families in the country. These devotees seem to mix and adopt various customs and doctrines of other foreign religions, both old and new, and they have a growing presence among the people."
