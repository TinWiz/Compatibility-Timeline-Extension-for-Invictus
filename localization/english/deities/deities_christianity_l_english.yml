Thomas founded the Church in India and the surrounding areas, travelling as far as China to spread the gospel of the Risen One. Thomas doubted the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth until he personally saw and touched the risen Christ according to the testimony of the Apostles. Hence he was nicknamed 'the Doubter'. Thomas founded the first seven Christian communities on the Malabar coast and died a martyr in Mailapur on the opposite Coromandel coast."

 deity_st_paul:0 "$omen_st_paul$"
 omen_st_paul:1 "St. Paul of Tarsus"
 omen_st_paul_desc:2 "Paul of Tarsus was a successful early Christian missionary and one of the earliest Christian theologians. As a Greek educated Jew and law-abiding Pharisee with Roman citizenship, Paul — whose Hebrew name was Saul — initially persecuted the followers of Jesus Christ, whom, apart from his appearance at his conversion, he never met. Since his conversion, however, he saw himself as a God-called Apostle of the gospel for the people. As such, he proclaimed the risen Jesus Christ, especially to non-Jews. To do this, he traveled to the eastern Mediterranean and founded several Christian communities there. He kept in touch with them through his letters."

 deity_st_nathanael_bartholomew:0 "$omen_st_nathanael_bartholomew$"
 omen_st_nathanael_bartholomew:1 "St. Nathanael Bartholomew"

 omen_st_matthew_levi:1 "St. Matthew Levi"
 omen_st_matthew_levi_desc:2 "Matthew is a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth, named as one of the twelve Apostles. The Apostle Matthew is identified with the author of the first of the four gospels of the New Testament, and this is why he is also venerated as an Evangelist. In solidarity with the Apostle and ex-tax collector Matthew, the other evangelists would have used the tribe name Levi instead of Matthew."

 deity_st_cornelius_centurion:0 "$omen_st_cornelius_centurion$"
 omen_st_cornelius_centurion:1 "St. Cornelius"
 omen_st_cornelius_centurion_desc:2 "The centurion Cornelius was a Roman centurion in Caesarea Maritima. He is considered to be one of the first non-Jews to be baptized as a Christian. According to the biblical story, he met an angel who asked him to bring the Apostle Simon Peter over to hear a message from him. The Apostle Simon Peter was convinced, also in a vision, that the message of salvation also applies to the Gentiles. Until then, he had assumed that it only applied to the Jews. Peter then allowed himself to be led into Cornelius' house by servants. Cornelius prostrated himself before Peter, but the latter did not allow him to worship him. While Peter was preaching, the Holy Spirit fell on everyone who was listening. That this also happened to non-Jews is presented as a great surprise for Peter and his Jewish companions. Peter then ordered Cornelius and his friends and relatives to be baptized. According to the biblical record, Cornelius is the first Roman Gentile Christian."

 deity_st_joseph:0 "$omen_st_joseph$"
 omen_st_joseph:1 "St. Joseph"
 omen_st_joseph_desc:2 "Joseph was the bridegroom and later husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus. He is referred to as the "foster father" of Jesus. Josef and his wife had to go to Bethlehem, the city of his birth, because of a census. After the birth of Jesus they returned to Jerusalem, where the presentation of the Lord was taking place in the temple. At an unspecified point in time after Jesus was born, the family had to flee from Bethlehem to Egypt on the orders of an angel, which Joseph received in a dream, since King Herod, for fear of the prophesied newborn King of the Jews who would displace him, killed all of the infants in Bethlehem. Later, on divine direction, which Joseph received in a dream, the family moved back to Palestine, where, by Joseph's decision, they did not settle in Judea, where Bethlehem is, but in Galilee in the village of Nazareth, where Jesus grew up. Joseph died in peace a few years before Jesus appeared in public."

 deity_st_mary:0 "$omen_st_mary$"
 omen_st_mary:1 "St. Mary the Virgin, Blessed Mother"
 omen_st_mary_desc:2 "Mary of Nazareth is the mother of Jesus. Hailed as the Blessed Virgin and Mother of God, Mary lived with her husband Joseph and other relatives in the village of Nazareth in Galilee. The angel Gabriel, who was sent to her, promised her the birth of a son, the Messiah and Son of God awaited by Israel. The address of the angel ('Greetings, you favored one, the Lord is with you') places Mary at the center of the salvation story. She asks the angel how this should be done, since she had never 'known' a man intimately. In answering, the angel told her she would conceive by the Holy Spirit. At the end of her earthly life, Mary was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory."

Together with his brother John, James is one of the first called disciples, along with Andrew and Simon Peter. James was on the Mount of Transfiguration with Peter and John when Jesus spoke to Elijah and Moses, and in the Garden of Gethsemane he witnessed Jesus in agony before the Passion he suffered. James and John received the Aramaic nickname 'Boanerges', which means Sons of Thunder, from Jesus because of their impetuous nature. After the Resurrection, James was in Jerusalem with the other Apostles. He was executed with the sword during the reign of Herod Agrippa I over all of Judea (AD 41–44)."

 deity_st_peter:0 "$omen_st_peter$"
 omen_st_peter:1 "St. Peter"
 omen_st_peter_desc:2 "Simon Peter was one of the first Jews called by Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah or Christ, to follow him. Simon was the spokesman for the disciples or Apostles, the first confessor, but also denied Jesus during his trial. He was an eyewitness to the risen Lord and one of the leaders of the early church in Jerusalem. Peter was the first bishop of Rome and Christ gave Peter and the successor bishops of Rome priority as leaders, teachers and judges of all Christians. The popes are therefore also referred to as 'successors of Peter'. According to Christian scriptures, Jesus answered Simon's confession of Christ with a special promise, 'You are Peter [Greek, petros] and on this rock [petra] I will build my church [ekklesia] and the powers [pylai, literally gates] of the underworld [hades] will not overwhelm'."

He is the author of the Gospel of Mark, and his symbol is the winged lion. The Apostle Peter encountered Mark and took him as a travel companion and interpreter. Mark the Evangelist wrote down the sermons of Peter, thus composing the Gospel. Mark was born in Cyrene, a city in the Pentapolis of North Africa (now Libya) and may have been the cousin of Barnabas. He preached the gospel in Alexandria, founding the church there and becoming its first bishop. He was martyred by the pagans of that city in AD 68."

 omen_archangel_gabriel:1 "Archangel Gabriel"
 omen_archangel_gabriel_desc:2 "Gabriel (Hebrew גַּבְרִיאֵל 'My strength is God') is one of the archangels and is considered to be the explainer of visions and a messenger of God. 'In the sixth month, however, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee, called Nazareth, to a virgin who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And he came in to her and said, Greetings, favored one. The Lord is with you. But she was taken aback by this word and wondered what kind of greeting it was. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary! for you have found favor with God. And, behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. And he will rule over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom will never end'."

 omen_archangel_michael:1 "Archangel Michael"
 omen_archangel_michael_desc:2 "Michael (Hebrew מיכאל 'Who is like God?') is an archangel and appears as the conqueror of Satan, whom he throws down to earth. 'A battle broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels rose to fight the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought, but they did not stand up and they lost their place in heaven. He was overthrown, the great dragon, the old serpent called the devil or Satan, who deceived the whole world; the dragon was thrown to the earth, and with him his angels were cast down'."

 omen_archangel_raphael:1 "Archangel Raphael"

Raphael is the angel who hears the prayer of Tobias (son of Tobit), accompanies him on his journey from Nineveh to Rages, gives him Sara in Ekbatana as his wife and heals Tobias' father Tobit. Raphael is considered the patron saint of the sick and pharmacists, as well as seamen and emigrants as well as pilgrims. He is traditionally regarded as a patron of roofers and miners. \nRaphael is not only the angel who heals wounds (Sara's obsession, Tobit's blindness), but also enables 'healing relationships'."

 deity_archangel_uriel:0 "$omen_archangel_uriel$"
 omen_archangel_uriel:1 "Archangel Uriel"
 omen_archangel_uriel_desc:2 "Uriel (Hebrew אוּרִיאֵל 'the light of God' or 'my light is God') is the name of an angel in Hebrew tradition. In the Roman Catholic Church, Uriel's veneration as archangel was obscured in the wake of the prohibitions on angel worship and cults, which are questionable from the church's point of view. Thus in 343–380 in the synod of Laodicea the false worship of angels and the creation of angel cults were forbidden, which had first gained widespread popularity already in the time of the apostles. Uriel is mentioned in the ancient Jewish scripture 4th Ezra, 'And the angel who was sent to me answered me by the name Uriel.' The statement embedded in the eulogium of the Coptic Church 'We venerate Uriel, as the fourth among the angels' secures his traditional position."
