 omen_manichaean_jesus:1 "Manichaean Jesus"
 omen_manichaean_jesus_desc:2 "Jesus in Manichaeism possessed three separate identities. (1) Jesus the Luminous, (2) Jesus the Messiah and (3) Jesus patibilis (the suffering Jesus). (1) As Jesus the Luminous his primary role was as supreme revealer and guide and it was he who woke Adam from his slumber and revealed to him the divine origins of his soul and its painful captivity by the body and mixture with matter. (2) Jesus the Messiah was a historical being who was the prophet of the Jews and the forerunner of Mani. However, the Manichaeans believed he was wholly divine, and that he never experienced human birth, as the physical realities surrounding the notions of his conception and his birth filled the Manichaeans with horror. (3) The pain suffered by the imprisoned Light-Particles in the whole of the visible universe, on the other hand, was real and immanent. This was symbolized by the mystic placing of the Cross whereby the wounds of the passion of our souls are set forth. On this mystical Cross of Light was suspended the Suffering Jesus (Jesus patibilis) who was the life and salvation of Man. This mystica cruxificio was present in every tree, herb, fruit, vegetable and even stones and the soil."

 omen_manichaean_buddha:1 "Gautama Buddha"
 omen_manichaean_buddha_desc:2 "Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the 'Religion of Light'. Buddhist influences were significant in the formation of Mani's religious thought. The transmigration of souls became a Manichaean belief, and the quadripartite structure of the Manichaean community, divided between male and female monks (the 'elect') and lay followers (the 'hearers') who supported them, appears to be based on that of the Buddhist sangha."

 omen_manichaean_zoroaster:1 "Zarathustra"
 omen_manichaean_zoroaster_desc:2 "Manichaeism claimed to present the complete version of teachings that were corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zoroaster, Buddha and Jesus. When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian yazatas. Thus Abbā dəRabbūṯā ('The Father of Greatness', the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in Middle Persian texts might either be translated literally as pīd ī wuzurgīh, or substituted with the name of the deity Zurwān. Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure Nāšā Qaḏmāyā 'The Original Man' was rendered Ohrmazd Bay, after the Zoroastrian god Ohrmazd."

 omen_prophet_mani:1 "Prophet Mani"
 omen_prophet_mani_desc:2 "Mani was the prophet and the founder of Manichaeism, a religion strongly influenced by Gnosticism, which spread with extraordinary speed through both the east and the west during his life and after his death. Mani was born in or near Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Babylonia, in 216 CE. Of Parthian descent, his parents were of the Jewish Gnostic Christian sect of the Elcesaites, who believed in reincarnation. Mani travelled to India where he studied Hinduism and Buddhism, and upon his return to Persia was taken into the court of a Zoroastrian king who favoured his syncretic teachings. Seven of Mani's major works were written in Syriac, and the eighth was written in Middle Persian. Mani was revered by his followers as the final prophet and reincarnation of Jesus, Buddha and Zoroaster, although he declared himself an 'apostle of Christ' and extant Manichaean poetry frequently extols Jesus and his mother, Mary, with the highest reverence. He eventually fell out of favour with his Zoroastrian royal patrons, who began to persecute the Manichaeans. He was imprisoned, tortured and executed in Gundeshapur sometime between 274 and 277 CE. According to sources, Mani passed his last days comforting his visiting disciples, teaching that his death would have no other consequence than the return of his soul to the realm of light."
