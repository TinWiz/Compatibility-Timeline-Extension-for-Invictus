 te_barbarians.1.t:0 "Barbarians on the Danube"
 te_barbarians.1.desc:1 "Hordes of germanic barbarians have appeared across the mountains and rivers of our borders. We do not know why they have begun to migrate into our territory, but they are wreaking havoc across the countryside and terrifying our people. They must be stopped or bargained with somehow!"
 te_barbarians.1.a:0 "Send our captains to deal with them, and our priests to offer sacrifices."

 te_barbarians.10.t:0 "Barbarians on the Rhine"
 te_barbarians.10.desc:1 "Hordes of germanic barbarians continue to cross the mountains and rivers of our borders. We do not know why they have begun to migrate into our territory, but they are wreaking havoc across the countryside and terrifying our people. They must be stopped or bargained with somehow!"
 te_barbarians.10.a:0 "It appears that they are fleeing some unknown terror in the wilderness beyond our maps."

 te_barbarians.11.t:0 "Frankish Tribes Grow"
 te_barbarians.11.desc:1 "Powerful tribes from Germania have organized and emerged across the Rhine, marching into our territory. These people are better equipped and trained in the art of military strategy, and must have learned from their more civilized neighbours. They are a significant threat and seem determined to conquer the land they occupy."
 te_barbarians.11.a:0 "If they cannot be defeated or bribed, then perhaps we can form an alliance?"

 te_barbarians.12.t:0 "Germanic Tribes Migrate"
 te_barbarians.12.desc:1 "The waves of Barbarians from Germania and beyond have increased in numbers, with new tribes forming and branching off from former tribes. Colder weather spells in the north and some other movement of nomads in the lands farther east are driving a mass migration of peoples across the continent, threatening the stability of our realm."
 te_barbarians.12.a:0 "We cannot stop this mass migration, but we must protect our own people."
 
 te_barbarians.13.t:0 "Nordic Vengeance"
 te_barbarians.13.desc:1 "Your expanding realm has reached the northern limits of the known world, driving the native inhabitants far into the frigid weald. Desperate and enraged, their barbarian armies invade your territories and attack the settlements of your own people, as the wild northmen seek to regain the homeland that you have taken from them."
 te_barbarians.13.a:0 "Shall we resist them, or relinquish this land?"

 te_barbarians.2.t:0 "The Huns Appear on the Volga"
 te_barbarians.2.desc:1 "The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Eastern Europe between the 4th and 6th century CE. According to European tradition, they were first reported living east of the Volga River, in an area that was part of Scythia at the time. By 370 CE, the Huns had arrived on the Volga."
 te_barbarians.2.a:0 "What manner of wild men are these? Where are they from? Why are they here?"

 te_barbarians.3.t:0 "Huns On the Pontic Steppe"
 te_barbarians.3.desc:1 "In 395 CE the Huns began their first large-scale attacks. In the summer of that year, the Huns crossed over the Caucasus Mountains, while in the winter of 395, another Hunnic invasion force crossed the frozen Danube, pillaged Thrace, and threatened Dalmatia. The much larger scale of the attacks on Asia Minor and Persia indicates that the bulk of the Huns had remained on the Pontic steppes rather than moving into Europe at this time. Hunnic attacks against Armenia would continue after this raid, with Armenian sources noting a Hunnic tribe known as the Xailandur as the perpetrators."
 te_barbarians.3.a:0 "These barbaric horse riders from the wilderness are worse than a pestilence."

 te_barbarians.4.t:0 "The Huns Grow in Strength"
 te_barbarians.4.desc:1 "The waves of barbarians from the east have continued and show no signs of stopping. They are bloodthirsty, well organized, trained in the arts of military warfare, and have mastered the skill of archery on horseback. These are no ordinary barbarians. Our armies are growing weary of chasing them on their constant raids and pillages, and some of their forces have moved deep into civilized lands as the helpless populace can only watch and wait or run in fear."
 te_barbarians.4.a:0 "We must turn our military and diplomatic power to protecting our people from this new scourge."

 te_barbarians.5.t:0 "Hunnic Invasion"
 te_barbarians.5.desc:1 "From 434 CE the brothers Attila and Bleda ruled the Huns together. Attila and Bleda were as ambitious as their uncle Rugila. In 435 they forced the Eastern Roman Empire to sign the Treaty of Margus, giving the Huns trade rights and an annual tribute from the Romans. In 447, Attila invaded the Balkans and Thrace. The war came to an end in 449 with an agreement in which the Romans agreed to pay Attila an annual tribute of 2100 pounds of gold. In 451, Attila's forces entered Gaul. Once in Gaul, the Huns first attacked Metz, then their armies continued westward, passing both Paris and Troyes to lay siege to Orléans."
 te_barbarians.5.a:0 "These vicious warriors swarm over the eastern borders and threaten us all!"

 te_barbarians.60.t:0 "Barbarians Beyond the Mountains"
 te_barbarians.60.desc:1 "Nomadic warrior tribes on horseback have begun to invade our territory from the northern steppes beyond the mountain passes. A migration of people is threatening our hold over the region. The sheer numbers and the furious desperation of these invaders is frightening to behold."
 te_barbarians.60.a:0 "Our rulership must be protected with power and might."

 te_barbarians.6.t:0 "Kidarites and Alchon Huns"
 te_barbarians.6.desc:1 "Rulers of Persia and India gradually lost the control of Bactria to invaders from Central Asia, first the Kidarites from around 335 CE, then the Alchon Huns from around 370 CE, who would follow up with the invasion of India a century later, and lastly the Hephthalites from around 450 CE."
 te_barbarians.6.a:0 "We are unstoppable and these strange new invaders are a mere nuisance."

 te_barbarians.70.t:0 "Hephthalites"
 te_barbarians.70.desc:1 "As they rose to prominence, the Hephthalites displaced the Kidarites and then the Alchon Huns, who expanded into Gandhara and Northern India. In 442 CE their tribes were fighting the Persians. In 456–457 a Hephthalite embassy arrived in China, during the reign of Emperor Wen of the Northern Wei. By 458 they were strong enough to intervene in Persia. Around 466 they probably took Transoxianan lands from the Kidarites with Persian help but soon took from Persia the area of Balkh and eastern Kushanshahr. In the second half of the fifth century they controlled the deserts of Turkmenistan as far as the Caspian Sea and possibly Merv."
 te_barbarians.70.a:0 "These wildlings have returned to harrass us. No matter, our mighty forces will crush them!"

 te_barbarians.7.t:0 "Alchon Huns Invasion of India"
 te_barbarians.7.desc:1 "Between 460 and 470 CE, the Alchons took over Gandhara and the Punjab which also had remained under the control of the Kidarites, while the Gupta Empire remained farther east. The Alkhon Huns may simply have filled the power vacuum created by the decline of the Kidarites, following their defeat in India against the Gupta Empire of Skandagupta in 455 CE, and their subsequent defeat in 467 CE against the Sasanian Empire of Peroz I, with Hephthalite and Alchon aid under Mehama, which put an end to Kidarite rule in Transoxiana once and for all.\nThe Alchons apparently undertook the mass destruction of Buddhist monasteries and stupas at Taxila, a high center of learning, which never recovered from the destruction. Virtually all of the Alchon coins found in the area of Taxila were found in the ruins of burned down monasteries, where apparently some of the invaders died alongside local defenders during the wave of destructions. It is thought that the Kanishka stupa, one of the most famous and tallest buildings in antiquity, was destroyed by them during their invasion of the area in the 460s CE. The Mankiala stupa was also vandalized during their invasions."
 te_barbarians.7.a:0 "Where others might have failed to stop these destructive hordes, we will prevail!"

 te_barbarians.90.t:0 "Bedouin Uprising"
 te_barbarians.90.desc:1 "Our borders have stretched far into the vast deserts of Arabia, where local policies of assimilation and conversion have pushed the native inhabitants to desperation. These nomadic tribes have arisen from the surrounding caves and are now fighting back to preserve their own culture and mastery over the lands of sand."
 te_barbarians.90.a:0 "Is this country of dunes worth the trouble?"

 te_barbarians.101.t:0 "Goths at the Gates"
 te_barbarians.101.desc:1 "Barbaric tribesmen known as Goths have appeared with large forces travelling down from the Carpathian Mountains and are marauding through our territory. They are primitive but organized, have some knowledge of the arts of war, and seem determined to stay. We must deal with them or they will overrun our land."
 te_barbarians.101.a:0 "Should we destroy them or settle with them?"

 te_barbarians.162.t:0 "Hyperborean Land Lost!"
 te_barbarians.162.desc:1 "Hyperborean natives migrating into our frontier territories have overwhelmed our settlers in [teinv_hyperbarian_invaded_province.GetName] and now claim the land of the area for their own."
 te_barbarians.162.a:0 "Perhaps we should let them have it for now."
 teinv_hyperbarian_invasion_tooltip:0 "#Y There are too many Hyperborean tribesmen in this distant region for you to control the land.#!"
