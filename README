This is a compatibility patch for Invictus version 1.4, working from the Simple I:R Timeline Extender v1.0.1, which is not compatible anymore because of changes with the base game province IDs (notably p:5975). 

Eventually this mod would either be and updated re-release of IRCK3, or a new version uploaded as a timeline extension specifically for Invictus only.
